# Photo-Editor-GUI

# Introduction:
This is a graphic user interface developed by Yunzhang Jiang for editing photo.
The effects in this editor includes cartoon effect, pencil effect, blur, negate, and auto-adjust. Also,
users are able to use multiple sliders to make more precise changes on RGB component and use
gamma correction.

# How to run the program:
Here is the user interface of the photo editor. Original photo is on the left and modified photo is on the right. On the bottom left corner, there are buttons for “negate”, “pencil effect”, “autoadjust” and “reset”. On the bottom right, there are several sliders that functions as described above the sliders. All the buttons and sliders are real-time and can work together (except for auto-adjust, which will be turned off once you move any sliders or click any buttons). If you want to go back to original image, click reset button.
