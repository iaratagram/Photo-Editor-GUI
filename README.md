# Photo-Editor-GUI


# How to run the program:
Here is the user interface of the photo editor. Original photo is on the left and modified photo is on the right. On the bottom left corner, there are buttons for “negate”, “pencil effect”, “autoadjust” and “reset”. On the bottom right, there are several sliders that functions as described above the sliders. All the buttons and sliders are real-time and can work together (except for auto-adjust, which will be turned off once you move any sliders or click any buttons). If you want to go back to original image, click reset button.
